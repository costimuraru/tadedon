See also AboutTadedon

The word _tadedon_ is a term coined by my little son. It refers to any vertical-axis [rotor](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotor) which is wider at the top then at the bottom.

It could be a carousel or an umbrella or a kind of toothbrush holder :)

# Why _tadedon_? #

  * The word is short.
  * As neologism it is also unique - easy findable on Google when typed explicitly.
  * I assume it consists of [syllable](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syllable)s typical for [Indo-European languages](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indo-European_languages) thus it should be easy to pronounce in these languages.
  * And last but not least - even if not really in etymological sense, semantically the meaning of _tadedon_ connotes _engine_ or _gear_ - some core component that makes the system running.
