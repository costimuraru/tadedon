The project is developed incrementally, as there is a need for new utility. Still there are some general goals which should be achieved.

  * release 1.0 (as soon as possible)
  * create maven repository for the project (snapshots) - is it possible to use mercurial as a storage?
  * find some CI server - possibly hudson, to perform CI, nightly, release builds.
  * after release try to put this library into maven central (via http://oss.sonatype.org/ )
